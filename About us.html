                   <p> Our story begins in 2010, with Edd Stafford proving to the world that any human being can explore the dense Amazon Forest. In that particular moment Edd and me thoughtthat could be a great opportunity to be the pioneers in offering  exciting adventures in the most diverse, challenging and dangerous environments.The strong friendship with Edd Stafford allowed me to come up with this idea, but without Edd's experience the Toucan Travel Agency would never be a real project. Our first step was to gather some of our friends and bring them along with the project, as they were really excited with the idea. We have examples in our friendship group that they got bored with their own jobs and decided to join us for real.</p>
